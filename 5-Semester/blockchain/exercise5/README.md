1) Follow the instructions on https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721 and implement your ERC721 token. Make the contract Ownable and let only the owner mint NFTs and set the URI.

    Deploy the token in the Görli network!

    As the contract owner, mint an NFT with the tokenId 1234 to yourself. 
    (Contract Address: 
    0xD4d0765910f3ebdf8aaAd2de54d2445EA5EA889C)

2) Create a JSON metadata file for the minted NFT and host it online.

    You can host it wherever you want. Github pages is a free option. If you are already familiar with IPFS, your can use it too.

    As the contract owner, set the URI of the ERC721 contract to point to the location where you host the JSON file. 

    3) Add your ERC721 token to MetaMask and send your NFT with the tokenId 1234 to the Görli address 0x15433DA387451F9dE4565280C85506CB71aF9376. Enter the hash / id of the transaction!
