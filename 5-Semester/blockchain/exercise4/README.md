1) Follow the instructions on https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc20 and implement your ERC20 token with an initial supply that results in 1000 units being minted.

    Deploy the token in the Görli network and enter its address!
(0xddC9C4Beaf5b2F36F30Ed599186c8D1F07CBD4cB)

2) Add your ERC20 token as asset to MetaMask and send 10.25 units to the Görli address 0x15433DA387451F9dE4565280C85506CB71aF9376.

    Enter the hash / id of the transaction!
(0x81cfc72801edf1d7be061c7af13714d87403dcd94c35078f83ce13f54e365886)

3) Rewrite your ERC20 token so that it requires accounts to be whitelisted by token holders to become valid recipients. The account receiving the initial supply should be whitelisted in the constructor.

    Deploy your contract on the Görli network and transfer 10.25 units of your ERC20 token to the address 0x15433DA387451F9dE4565280C85506CB71aF9376.

    Enter the address of the ERC20 token contract and attach its source code file!
